# 🤖 automas

Welcome to **automas**, my growing collection of scripts that do all the boring stuff so I don’t have to.  
Think of it as my personal army of little robots, each one living in its own folder, each one with a job to do.

## 📂 Structure

Every script has:

- Its **own folder** (because sharing is overrated).
- A **README** that explains what it does and how not to break it.
- (Sometimes) a **requirements.txt** if it needs fancy extras.

```

## 🧭 Navigator (just for fun)

Want to feel like you’re hacking into the Matrix? Use the built-in **Script Navigator CLI**:

```bash
./navigator.sh
```

What it does:

- Shows you categories and scripts
- Lets you run them directly from a menu
- Can even peek at their content or README
- Adds just enough color to make you feel like a real hacker

_(Pro tip: If it breaks, don’t panic. That’s part of the fun.)_

## 🛠️ Scripts

Here’s the lineup of my minions:

- [**script-one**](scripts/script-one) – Does X, Y, Z. Saves me about 17 seconds of life every time I use it.
- [**script-two**](scripts/script-two) – Automates ABC. If you run it twice, don’t blame me.
- [**script-three**](scripts/script-three) – Utility for DEF. May or may not summon dark forces.

_(More to come, because my laziness is infinite.)_

## 🚀 Usage

1. Pick a script.
2. Read its README (seriously, read it — future you will thank you).
3. Run it.
4. Brag about how productive you are now.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These scripts work on **my machine™**.  
If they break yours… consider it character development.

## 🎉 Contribute?

This is mostly for me, but if you have ideas, fixes, or just want to make the code less embarrassing, PRs are welcome.
