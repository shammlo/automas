# üöÄ Nginx Static Site Setup Script

A powerful Bash script that automates Nginx configuration for local static websites, now with **SSL support**, **SPA routing**, **API proxying**, and a whole lot more. Works on **Linux** and **macOS** (because we believe in choices, unlike some operating systems üëÄ).

> **Enhanced Features:** SSL certificates, custom TLDs, SPA support, API proxying, list/remove commands, dry-run mode, and comprehensive validation. It's like the original script went to college and got a PhD in being awesome.

---

## üìã What It Does

This script simplifies the process of hosting static websites locally by:

1. ‚úÖ **Smart Setup**: Detects your OS and validates Nginx availability (no more "command not found" surprises)
2. üìù **Flexible Configs**: Creates domain-specific Nginx configurations with SSL, SPA routing, and API proxying support
3. üîí **SSL Magic**: Auto-generates self-signed certificates for HTTPS development (because even localhost deserves encryption)
4. üåê **Custom Domains**: Supports any TLD (`.io`, `.dev`, `.local`, or whatever makes you happy)
5. ÔøΩ **SPA Ready**: Perfect routing for React, Vue, Angular apps (no more 404s on refresh!)
6. ÔøΩ *R*API Proxying\*_: Forward `/api/_` requests to your backend (full-stack development made easy)
7. üéõÔ∏è **Port Freedom**: Use any port you want (because 80 is so mainstream)
8. üìã **Site Management**: List, create, and remove sites with simple commands
9. üß™ **Dry Run Mode**: Preview changes before applying them (for the cautious developers)
10. üõ°Ô∏è **Safety First**: Comprehensive validation, backups, and rollback mechanisms

---

## üí° Why It's Useful

### Without this script (aka "The Dark Ages"):

- Manual Nginx setup and troubleshooting (cue the dramatic music and pulling of hair)
- Error-prone editing of `/etc/hosts` (who knew a simple text file could be so temperamental?)
- Risk of permission issues that make your site vanish into the digital void
- Forgotten syntax or missed steps that make you question your life choices

### With this script (aka "Living in 2025"):

- **Simple setup** that actually works:

```bash
./ngx.sh create myapp /path/to/dist
```

- **Advanced setup** for the power users:

```bash
./ngx.sh create myapp /path/to/dist --ssl --spa --api http://localhost:3001 --tld .dev
```

- **Site management** made easy:

```bash
./ngx.sh list              # See all your sites
./ngx.sh remove myapp      # Clean removal
```

- Fully automated config with SSL, SPA routing, and API proxying (it's like having a DevOps team in a script)
- Works across Linux distros and macOS (because we don't discriminate)
- Safe to run with dry-run mode, backups, rollback, and validation (yes, we're that responsible)
- Predictable, reproducible setup for every project (no more "but it worked on my machine!" excuses)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### üßê Smart Validation & Setup

The script now comes with a brain! It validates:

- Nginx installation and availability (no more mysterious failures)
- Folder existence and web file detection (suggests SPA mode for React apps)
- Port conflicts (warns you before things get messy)
- SSL certificate requirements (handles the crypto magic for you)

### üîí SSL Certificate Generation

When you use `--ssl`, the script becomes a mini certificate authority:

- Generates a private key (2048-bit RSA, because we're not amateurs)
- Creates a self-signed certificate (valid for 365 days of local development bliss)
- Configures proper SSL settings in Nginx (TLS 1.2/1.3, secure ciphers)
- Sets up HTTP to HTTPS redirect (because mixed content is the enemy)

Your certificates live in `/etc/ssl/certs/` and `/etc/ssl/private/` like proper SSL citizens.

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Flexible Domain System

No more `.io` tyranny! Choose your own adventure:

```bash
# Default .io (for the startup vibes)
myapp ‚Üí myapp.io

# Custom TLD (for the rebels)
myapp --tld .dev ‚Üí myapp.dev
myapp --tld .local ‚Üí myapp.local

# It's smart enough not to double up
myapp.com --tld .dev ‚Üí myapp.dev
```

Perfect for matching your production domains or just feeling fancy with `.dev` domains!

---

### üìù Smart Nginx Configuration

Creates configurations that adapt to your needs:

**Basic Static Site:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name myapp.io www.myapp.io;
    root /path/to/your/dist;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

**SPA with SSL and API Proxy:**

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name myapp.io www.myapp.io;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name myapp.io www.myapp.io;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/myapp.io.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/myapp.io.key;

    root /path/to/your/dist;

    location /api/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3001/;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;  # SPA routing magic
    }
}
```

The script generates exactly what you need based on your flags. No bloat, no confusion, just clean configs.

---

### üåê Intelligent Hosts Management

- Adds your custom domain to `/etc/hosts` (telling your computer "hey, when someone asks for myapp.dev, just look in the mirror")
- Prevents duplicates and handles updates gracefully
- Use `--force` to override existing entries (for those "I know what I'm doing" moments)
- Automatic cleanup when removing sites (no orphaned entries cluttering your hosts file)

---

### üîê Security & Permissions

- Sets proper permissions on your dist folder (secure but not paranoid)
- Configures Nginx to run as your user (because running as root is like wearing a tuxedo to do yard work)
- SSL certificates get proper restrictive permissions (600 for keys, 644 for certs)
- Validates folder contents and suggests improvements (like SPA mode for React apps)

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Safety Features

- **Dry-run mode**: Preview all changes before applying them (`--dry-run`)
- **Automatic rollback**: If anything fails, everything gets restored (like a time machine for your configs)
- **Comprehensive backups**: All modified files get backed up automatically
- **Validation everywhere**: Nginx configs, SSL certificates, folder contents, port conflicts
- **Graceful error handling**: Clear error messages with suggestions for fixes
- **Quiet/Verbose modes**: Control exactly how much the script talks to you
- **Emoji logging**: Because who doesn't love a little joy in their terminal? ‚ú®

## üöÄ Usage

### Commands (because the script is all grown up now)

```bash
# Create a new site
./ngx.sh create <domain> <path> [options]

# List all configured sites
./ngx.sh list

# Remove a site (clean removal)
./ngx.sh remove <domain> [options]

# Show version info
./ngx.sh version

# Get help (RTFM, but friendly)
./ngx.sh --help
```

### Basic Examples (the "I just want it to work" approach)

```bash
# Simple static site
./ngx.sh create myapp ./dist

# With SSL (because security matters)
./ngx.sh create myapp ./dist --ssl

# SPA with custom TLD (for the React/Vue crowd)
./ngx.sh create myapp ./dist --spa --tld .dev
```

### Advanced Examples (for the power users)

```bash
# Full-stack development setup
./ngx.sh create myapp ./dist --ssl --spa --api http://localhost:3001 --tld .dev

# Custom port with API proxy
./ngx.sh create api ./dist --port 8080 --api http://localhost:3000

# Preview changes first (for the cautious)
./ngx.sh create myapp ./dist --ssl --spa --dry-run

# Force update existing site
./ngx.sh create myapp ./dist --ssl --force

# Quiet mode (minimal output)
./ngx.sh create myapp ./dist --quiet

# Remove a site when you're done
./ngx.sh remove myapp
```

### Create Options (for the control freaks)

| Flag                | Description                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `--dry-run`     | Preview what would be removed |
| `-v, --verbose` | Show detailed removal process |
| `-q, --quiet`   | Minimal output                |

## üìã Requirements

- **Linux/macOS** with Bash (sorry Windows users, we're still working on that relationship)
- **Sudo privileges** (to modify system files without breaking everything)
- **Static site output folder** (e.g. from React/Vue/Gatsby build processes)

You **don't need to pre-install Nginx**, the script handles it for you like a proper gentleman.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Files Modified (aka "What We're Touching on Your System")

| Path                       | Description                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf` | Your shiny new Nginx site configurations   |
| `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`    | Set to run as your user (not the overlord) |
| `/etc/hosts`               | Maps custom domains to `127.0.0.1`         |
| `/etc/ssl/certs/*.crt`     | SSL certificates (when using --ssl)        |
| `/etc/ssl/private/*.key`   | SSL private keys (when using --ssl)        |
| `~/.ngx/config`            | Your personal configuration preferences    |

Backups are created for all modified files because we're not monsters. The script also cleans up after itself when removing sites.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting (aka "When Things Go Wrong")

### ‚ùå Permission Denied (the classic)

Make sure the script can actually run:

```bash
chmod +x ngx.sh
```

### üîÅ Nginx Not Starting (the drama queen)

Check what's going on:

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo nginx -t  # Test configuration
```

### üåê Domain Not Working (the "but it should work!" moment)

Verify your hosts entry and nginx config:

```bash
grep "yourdomain.dev" /etc/hosts
./ngx.sh list  # See all configured sites
```

### üîí SSL Certificate Issues (the security theater)

Check certificate generation and permissions:

```bash
sudo ls -la /etc/ssl/certs/yourdomain.dev.crt
sudo ls -la /etc/ssl/private/yourdomain.dev.key
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Config Issues (when Nginx gets picky)

Test and debug configurations:

```bash
sudo nginx -t  # Test all configs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log  # Watch for errors
```

### üîç Port Conflicts (when something else is hogging your port)

Find what's using your port:

```bash
netstat -tuln | grep :8080
lsof -i :8080  # More detailed info
```

### üß™ Use Dry-Run Mode (when you're not sure)

Preview changes before applying:

```bash
./ngx.sh create myapp ./dist --ssl --spa --dry-run
```

---

## üßπ Site Management (for the organized developers)

### List All Sites

```bash
./ngx.sh list
```

Shows all configured sites with paths, SSL status, and config files.

### Remove Sites (the civilized way)

```bash
# Preview what will be removed
./ngx.sh remove myapp --dry-run

# Actually remove it (cleans up everything)
./ngx.sh remove myapp
```

This removes:

- Nginx configuration file
- SSL certificates (if any)
- Hosts file entries
- Reloads Nginx automatically

### Manual Cleanup (if you're feeling adventurous)

```bash
# Remove config manually
sudo rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/myapp_dev.conf

# Remove SSL certificates
sudo rm /etc/ssl/certs/myapp.dev.crt
sudo rm /etc/ssl/private/myapp.dev.key

# Remove hosts entry
sudo sed -i '/myapp.dev/d' /etc/hosts

# Reload nginx
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

But seriously, just use `./ngx.sh remove myapp`. It's safer and handles edge cases.

---

## üßô Terminal Wizardry (For Bash/Zsh Wielders)

If you **really love magic**, and want to summon `ngx` from anywhere in your terminal, do this:

```bash
# Create a symlink (the professional way)
sudo ln -s $(pwd)/scripts/ngx/ngx.sh /usr/local/bin/ngx

# Or create an alias (the quick way)
echo "alias ngx='$(pwd)/scripts/ngx/ngx.sh'" >> ~/.$(basename "$SHELL")rc
```

Then reload your shell to complete the ritual:

```bash
source ~/.$(basename "$SHELL")rc
```

Now you can cast spells from anywhere:

```bash
# Create a full-stack development environment
ngx create myapp ./dist --ssl --spa --api http://localhost:3001 --tld .dev

# List all your magical creations
ngx list

# Banish a site to the shadow realm
ngx remove myapp
```

Boom. You‚Äôre now a **CLI wizard**. No more fumbling through folders, just type `ngx` and rewrite the server config like a digital warlock. üî•

> Just don‚Äôt alias it in **fish**, **csh**, or **tcsh**.
> Even **Nginx** will get mad. It‚Äôll refuse to reload. Your logs will cry.
> **Don‚Äôt say we didn‚Äôt warn you.**
